This is the folder that stores all sample test files.
Sample test files should be inputs separated by newlines (not just the string '\n'). 
It doesn't hurt to pad newlines at the end of a file, but having too few will cause the process to hang. 
(A hanging script will be detected in a few seconds and aborted/reported as such.)

Example:
This is an input string to search for a query.
query
